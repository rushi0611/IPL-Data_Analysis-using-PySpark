> Developed a Spark-based solution to analyze IPL match data using PySpark, SQL queries, and data visualizations.
> Created schemas and processed data from CSV files for ball-by-ball, match, and player statistics.
> Performed aggregations (total and average runs, wickets), window functions, and conditional columns (e.g., high-impact deliveries).
> Generated insights on top-scoring batsmen, economical bowlers, toss outcomes, and venue-wise scores.
> Visualized results using Matplotlib and Seaborn for trends like dismissal types and average runs in winning matches.
